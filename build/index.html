    About Me
  </h1>
  <img src="linkedin.png" alt="my photo">
  Hello! My name is Sayan Bakshi and I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Panjab University.
  <br>
  <br>
  I have a strong passion for technology and programming, and have honed my skills in several programming languages, including C/C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with the MERN stack. I am also just starting out in the world of cloud computing and have a beginner's understanding of AWS, demonstrating my versatility and commitment to staying up-to-date with industry advancements. I also have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms along with understanding of OOPS, OS and DBMS.
  <br>
  <br>
  I have practical experience working in a startup, where I was responsible for building the first version of their web application and deploying it over the cloud. This hands-on experience has taught me the importance of teamwork, attention to detail, and efficient problem-solving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aside from my professional work, I am also an avid lover of competitive programming. The thrill of racing against the clock to solve a problem continues to drive me every day. Competitive programming and development both, got the curious little kid inside me awake again, experimenting with things knowing no bounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am excited to continue my education and professional development as I work towards my goal of becoming a skilled software engineer.
