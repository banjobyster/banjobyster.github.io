    About Me
  </h1>
  <img src="linkedin.png" alt="my photo">
  I am currently pursuing B.E in Computer Science and Engineering from UIET, Panjab University. I am of batch 2020-24. I started with developing games that helped me explore areas such as procedural generation, rasterization, shaders, ray tracing as well as gave me insights into artificial intelligence, compute shaders, and simulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  My journey in coding started with Google's grasshopper app which taught me the basics of javascript. From there on, I learned C/C++, gdScript while working on Godot, C# with Unity and currently learning Html, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Development.
  <br>
  <br>
  I am in absolute love with competitive programming. The adrenaline rush that I get while racing against time to beat my personal best and solving the rank deciding question at the last moment is what I crave for daily. Being stuck at a question for several days and then finally solving it makes each second worth it.
  <br>
  <br>
 Competitive programming and development both, got the curious little kid inside me awake again, experimenting with things knowing no bounds.
